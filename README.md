We dug into the advertising around the 2024 + 2025 Women’s and Men’s NCAA Final Four and Championship games using Kinetiq’s ad detection technology—and uncovered some surprising takeaways.

From brand category trends to year-over-year investment changes, the findings highlight how advertisers are approaching these marquee events differently by gender, game, and year.
